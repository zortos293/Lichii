// Finds the NVN2 (Switch 2) shader programs a game ships, by their content: every RomFS file is
// read, zstd (with the game's dictionaries) and Yaz0 are undone, SARC archives are expanded, and
// BNSH (shader archives, effect bundles, layouts), agl BAHS packs, agl NDSR packs, nn::ndve movie
// files and sead's primitive drawer are parsed; other data is searched for embedded BNSH.
//
// Programs are cut as the game's GPU reads them (control section, then code area of the length
// the control section names at +0x44) and fingerprinted like nxnative's shader_split.py
// (github.com/seedds/nxnative, MIT): SHA-256 of the first 0x48 control bytes with +0x30..+0x33
// zeroed, then the code area; the first 8 bytes. Format notes are from that script and from
// tools/nx2/shader_archive.py.
