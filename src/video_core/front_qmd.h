/// The QMD scheduling of every channel (Tegra::NativeQmdScheduler), run on the split GPU thread's
/// front as its back will run it, on a table of its own: what the launches release is known when
/// they are sent, for the front's view of the semaphore words (GpuSplit::NoteSemaphoreWrite).
///
/// The table is the back's from the start: an engine's front takes it over with the back drained
/// when it takes the engine's macros over (TakeOver). It stays the back's as long as the front
/// reads the descriptors the back will read. The front reads one when it sends a signal, the back
/// when it runs it, both from guest memory without the GPU caches. The front takes a descriptor:
/// - from the signal's own inline QMD, which the back writes right before;
/// - from memory, once the back ran every write sent there (GpuSplit::MemoryWritesTarget: the
///   writes placed in its granule and the unplaced ones), on pages GPU work never wrote
///   (Nx2MayBeGpuWritten);
/// - from the inline QMD a LOAD_INLINE_QMD_DATA still queued writes there, when that is the last
///   write sent there (NoteInlineWrite);
/// - from the words an inline upload still queued writes there, when that is the last write sent
///   there, and around them from memory once the back ran the writes before it (NoteUpload).
/// No change of the GPU's mappings may be queued either (GpuSplit::LastMappingChange). Memory holds
/// what the back finds there only while the back has not run the signal's entry yet: the front
/// sends and values it under a GpuSplit::PublishHold.
///
/// Where the back has yet to run a write the front can't read past (into a QMD the signal reads,
/// or anywhere, or to the mappings), the signal waits, with what it changed in the table taken
/// back (NativeQmdScheduler::BeginAttempt), and every signal sent after it waits behind it: the
/// table stays the back's as of the signals valued. The front values the waiting ones in order
/// once the back ran what the first waits for (CatchUp). Late, the back may have run the signal
/// and what followed it, so memory holds what the back read only where nothing sent after the
/// signal writes the QMD, and no release of the waiting signals writes a QMD read late. Their
/// releases are placed at their signals' positions, not noted. Where the front can't read what
/// the back read at all (a QMD on a GPU-written page, written after the signal, released into,
/// or the mappings changed after it), it loses the table: it stops valuing, and takes the back's
/// table over the next time the back has run everything sent, between commands or at a QMD
/// method (MaybeTakeOver).
///
/// `Memory`, the channel's GPU address space as the back reads it, has:
/// - bool IsMapped(GPUVAddr, u64), void Read(GPUVAddr, void*, u64), u32 ReadWord(GPUVAddr) (as
///   MemoryManager::Read<u32>), bool InSyncpointShim(GPUVAddr, u64);
/// - std::optional<u64> Device(GPUVAddr), bool GpuWritten(u64 device, u64 size);
/// - u64 WritesTarget(const GpuSplit&, GPUVAddr, u64), void NoteWrite(GpuSplit&, GPUVAddr, u64),
