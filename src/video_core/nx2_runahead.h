// EDEN_NX2_RUNAHEAD=1: the split GPU thread's front stays ahead of its back where the baseline
// makes it wait for writes that cannot reach the word it acquires.
//
// A Switch 2 semaphore acquire whose word in memory (or whose last release sent) already meets it,
// but that the semaphore view cannot call settled (an equal acquire, or a word the mirror diverts),
// waits in the baseline until the back has run every compute and copy entry sent before it
// (GpuSplit::LastWriterPosition: every compute macro call, upload, report, QMD method and copy
// method), then asks the view again. With the switch the acquire waits only for the entries that
// can change the word other than through the releases the view sees at it
// (GpuSplit::RunAheadReach): QMD signals whose releases the front did not note when it sent them,
// placed writes over the word's 4 bytes (copies, uploads, QMD releases placed late, report bytes
// past the words noted), writes the front could not place, and, on a page GPU work ever wrote,
// every compute and copy entry as before. Nothing else sent before the acquire can change the
// word, so the view the baseline asks after its wait answers as it answers once those ran: the
// same decision, sooner. Two more pieces keep the front ahead: a QMD signaled while the inline
// upload that writes it is still queued is read from the upload's words the front sent
// (FrontQmdView), so the front keeps valuing QMD releases; and a greater-or-equal acquire on the
// syncpoint shim that the guest syncpoint meets already passes without draining the split
// (syncpoints only grow).
//
// The writes a dispatch's shaders store go to the GPU caches: only on a page GPU work wrote may
// they reach guest memory as acquires read it (Nx2MayBeGpuWritten), and there the reach stays
// the baseline's. EDEN_NX2_RUNAHEAD_VERIFY=1 checks every acquire passed sooner on the back, at
// its place in the ring, against the word as the baseline would read it after its wait.
