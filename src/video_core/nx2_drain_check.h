// EDEN_NX2_DRAIN_CHECK: what the split GPU thread's front would see without some of its waits for
// the back, counted without changing what runs and logged every 10 s by the front:
// - command lists on pages no GPU work had written that did not wait for the compute and copy
//   work sent after the last host-level wait (DmaPusher::Step): how many of them that work made
//   GPU-written, checked on the back at the list's place. It must stay 0;
// - semaphore acquires, and the polls of suspended ones (Puller): whether the value met the
//   acquire before the front drained the split and after, by whether the GPU had released a
//   semaphore at that address before (any engine, RasterizerInterface::Query with a payload);
// - acquires and polls the semaphore view decides (Puller AskView), verified: the front drains
//   and reads the word as before anyway, and counts the decisions the drain contradicts. A pass
//   the drained word does not meet must stay 0; such a pass is corrected (the channel waits), and
//   a wait the drained word meets ends (counted: a drain would have passed or resumed it);
// - the releases the front noted for the QMD launches it valued (FrontQmdView), against the ones
//   the back then ran, compared on the back right after the QMD methods, and the descriptors the
//   front read for them (from memory, the signal's inline QMD or a queued one) against the ones
//   the back read; the descriptors the front read for signals it valued late (they waited) against
//   the ones the back read running them, by their position; whether the back could have run an
//   entry the front valued when it read memory for it. Every 512th time, and after every signal
//   valued late, the front's whole QMD table against the back's. Wrong ones must stay 0.
