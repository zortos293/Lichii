// Graphics pipeline libraries (VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library).
//
// A pipeline is linked from four parts: vertex input, pre-rasterization shaders, fragment shader
// and fragment output. The two shader parts are what the driver spends seconds on; they are built
// once per shader (and the little state the driver bakes into them) and shared by every pipeline
// that uses that shader, whatever its partner stage. The vertex input and fragment output parts
// are cheap and built per pipeline. A new pipeline whose shaders were seen before costs a link
// (a fraction of a millisecond with fast linking).
//
// For a shader library to be independent of its partner, each stage has its own descriptor set
// (set index = stage index, VK_PIPELINE_LAYOUT_CREATE_INDEPENDENT_SETS_BIT_EXT) with its bindings
// numbered from 0, and the fragment stage's texture and image rescaling bits start at a fixed
// index instead of after the previous stages' ones.
//
// Libraries are keyed by the SPIR-V the stage was emitted to (a 128-bit hash), the stage's
// descriptor set layout, the push constant range, the state the part bakes in, the dynamic state
// list, the render pass and the creation flags. Keying by the emitted SPIR-V is always correct;
// it is less reuse than possible when the emission depends on the partner stage or on state (see
// MakeRuntimeInfo), which can be narrowed later in the emission.
//
// Based in part on suyu-main 3157ae0ce0 and f80bbc701a (library cache with build outside the
// lock, fast link then optimized link, link statistics); unlike there, the shader libraries here
// do not depend on the partner stage.
