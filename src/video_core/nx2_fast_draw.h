/// A draw that follows a draw of the same pipeline with only light state changes in between takes
/// the delta path. It keeps the previous draw's pipeline, image views, samplers and texture buffer
/// bindings. Buffers are resolved and bound again, except small streamed uniforms whose ranges
/// were not rebound or written: those can keep the previous stream allocation in the same command
/// buffer. This assumes no unsynchronized guest CPU writes unknown to the caches between draws;
/// EDEN_NX2_UBO_KEEP_VERIFY checks that assumption. Kept image descriptors and rescaling words are
/// replayed while the views remain valid; EDEN_NX2_DELTA_DESCRIPTORS_VERIFY checks the replay.
/// Light changes are draw parameters, index buffer and vertex stream registers, constant buffer
/// binds and inline constant buffer data (collected in g_delta: the rasterizer resolves in full
/// when they reach the pipeline's texture handles at their GPU addresses or through another
/// mapping of their device memory). Anything else that could change what a resolve produces bumps
/// a serial: a 3D register that changes, any 3D method with side effects (uploads, reports,
/// clears, barriers, ...), constant buffer data reaching the texture or sampler headers (the same
/// way), any other engine, deferred calls on the split's back (except the ones marked
/// GpuSplit::FastDrawNeutral), GPU::TickWork requests, texture cache writes, unmaps and
/// deletions, shader removals, fence releases, HLE macros and frames. The rasterizer takes the
/// delta path only while the serial, the GPU memory map, the command buffer, the render pass and
/// the bound pipeline are the ones the previous draw left. A draw of another pipeline (or after a
/// draw that can't be followed) takes it with what that pipeline kept at its own last draw while
/// the memory serial, the map, the command buffer, the render pass and the texture pool registers
/// are the ones that draw left, reading every texture handle again (the rasterizer's RevisitDraw).
