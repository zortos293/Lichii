# Ocarina of Time: bypassing the game's anti-aliasing network

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (`0400486024DEC000`) runs a tensor network on its tonemapped
image followed by an output pass that sharpens hard. The No sharpening option
(`oot_anti_aliasing`) shows the tonemapped image and can also skip the update's network passes.

## What the game does

The update (1.1.1) was inspected in Kokiri Forest, docked at 1x with the built-in Max Resolution
patch. Sampled frame dumps, constant-buffer traces and pixel statistics showed:

- The 3D renders at the output size (2560x1440 docked), with no jitter and no motion vectors.
- The tonemap pass (fragment shader `bded5ce917183214` outdoors, `3ac011bd2d772994` outdoors at
  another time of day, `6cb06edf14be1d79` indoors) renders a B10G11R11 image.
- The game then runs, on that **tonemapped** image: a prepass (`8475d671e6967428`), a heavy
  dispatch (shader `d9ee412f00ce399a`), the network (`42593194bb0b2b32`) and an output pass
  (`da6df3e54c716df2`) that writes the B10G11R11 image the rest of the frame uses (texture handle
  at cb0+0xd0). Keys are native program keys.
- The network keeps no history: it is a single-frame spatial smoother (mean |Laplacian| of green
  0.0042 -> 0.0037). The output pass then sharpens hard: 2.2x the input's edge contrast, with
  overshoot up to 1.72 on bright edges. That is the halo users see.
- Only the HUD and a plain copy for presentation follow the output pass.

In the base game (1.0.0), the same tonemap can run below the output resolution. A frame dump in the
Temple of Time showed a 1920x1080 tonemapped scene feeding a 2560x1440 output. The base game's
output shaders use the same constant-buffer handle offsets as the update.

## What No sharpening does

- On 1.1.1, `ShaderCache::ComputeShader` calls `KeplerCompute::BypassOotNetwork`. The output
  pass uses a same-size point copy. The prepass and network are skipped while the replacement works.
- On 1.0.0, `KeplerCompute::BypassOotBaseNetwork` recognizes the known output programs from
  `DispatchNativeCompute` before translation, which can reject their per-tap gathers. The game
  selects different programs as the internal resolution changes. Match the full native key for
  each candidate that shares the first word. The replacement uses a bilinear copy that can scale
  the tonemap up to the output resolution. The base game's other compute passes still run.
- Both paths use `AccelerateSurfaceCopy` and get the output format, size and block-linear layout
  from the output pass's texture descriptor at cb0+0xd0.

The images are learned at run time, not hard-coded: the tonemapped image is render target 0 of the
latest draw whose pipeline has a tonemap fragment shader
(`RasterizerVulkan::TrackOotTonemappedImage`), and the output is whatever the output pass's handle
selects. Nothing is replaced until the tonemapped image has been seen. The prepass and the network
are skipped only while the output pass is being replaced. The replacement requires two
B10G11R11 block-linear images, and the input must fit the output dimensions (an exact match on
1.1.1). If the copy fails, dispatch falls back to the game's shader. The copy's source takes
its dimensions and block layout from the tonemap draw's render target. The state lives in the
rasterizer (`OotNetwork::BypassState`) because the tonemap pass draws on the 3D engine and the
network's passes do not all run on the same compute engine.

NVIDIA DLSS takes precedence: while Ocarina DLSS is enabled ("Use NVIDIA DLSS in place of a
game's DLSS" on, with DLSS available from Streamline), `RasterizerVulkan::OotNetworkBypass` returns
null and No sharpening does nothing, because DLSS replaces the same output pass
(docs/native-dlss-replacement.md). The log says
`Ocarina of Time: No sharpening is off while NVIDIA DLSS is on` once. Once DLSS turns itself off
for the session or its evaluation fails, No sharpening takes over from the next frame.

The game's constants (shader hashes, program keys, the cb0 offset) are in
`src/video_core/oot_network.h`.

## Results (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5090, Kokiri Forest, 1x)

| Mode | fps | Image |
|---|---|---|
| Game | ~41 | sharpened, halos |
| No sharpening | ~50 | clean; edges aliased as rendered, pairs with resolution scaling |

## Caveats

- The known shader keys cover base 1.0.0 (main build ID
  `33FA6C2C23848282A77E8B88A0A93F4887C55920`) and update 1.1.1
  (`E0F3CCFAF50065AE4EA01EB5AEB13B1A45DA3348`). A different revision needs its shaders checked.
- B10G11R11 has little precision in dark tones: without the network's smoothing some banding
  shows in deep shadows.
- The heavy dispatch between the prepass and the network still runs; its result goes unused.
- Vulkan only: other backends never learn the tonemapped image, so the setting has no effect there.
